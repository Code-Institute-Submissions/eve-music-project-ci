# eve DJ Website
![eve Logo](assets/images/logo.png)

For this milestone project I decided to make a website spcecifically designed for the DJ group **eve**. By combining all the learning and study from the previous three modules I have designed a fully responsive front-end website using HTML5, CSS3, Boostootstrap and other CSS libraries/frameworks that will be credited further into this README.

**eve** are a collective of three fermale DJ's residing in Dublin. They have a good online presence in the form of social media but have not got their own personal website. The benefits of this website for the client will be to increase their fan abse, gain them future bookings and give their users are expierience that will keep them coming back to the site.

# UX
The client wants a website where they can showcase their music/media from previous gigs to boost their fanbase and also have a site for returning fans to keep up to date with whats going on. They also want to have a section where they can be booked by promoters for future gigs.

In summary the main focus of the website will be to:
 * Desing a website that will lead to bookings & increase fan base
 * Boost online presence
 * Present a UX that will encourage users to return to the website
 * Have easy access to all other platforms of media / online content for promotion of the artist

## **User Stories**
